# Python Programming for Data Science Course

Welcome to the repository for the **Python Programming for Data Science Course**!

This Python course for Data Science provides an introduction to using Python for data analysis and manipulation. It involves extracting insights from data through statistical techniques, visualization, and machine learning, with Python being one of the most popular languages for this purpose.

## Course Content

### 1. Introduction to Python
- **Basic Concepts**: Syntax, variables, and data types.
- **Decision Structures and Loops**: Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loops (`for`, `while`) for flow control.
- **Collections**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets for storing and manipulating data.
- **Functions**: Creating functions to modularize code, including parameters and return values.
- **File Manipulation**: Reading and writing text and CSV files.

### 2. Python for Data Science
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical calculations and manipulation of multidimensional arrays.
- **Pandas**: Essential tool for manipulating tabular data, including reading files, cleaning, and transforming data using dataframes.
- **Datetime**: Module for working with dates and times, essential for time series and temporal analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries that allow the creation of intuitive graphs and visualizations to facilitate data analysis and interpretation.
